## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

First of all, download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and your favourite IDE (I used [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)) and install the packages given in the **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** file. Python Version `3.6` or higher is required.

Package installation can be done by using the [`pip install`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/) command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>

**Note** : It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install your packages inside the virtual environment

```bash
# Installing virtualenv
pip install virtualenv

# Creating virtual environment folder:
virtualenv venv


# Activating environment

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Finally installing packages inside environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üö® Forking this repo (please read!)

_**yes, with attribution**_.

I value keeping my work open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my work without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this project, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
